FOCUS ON BUSINESS & PROJECT CLARITY - NOT PROPOSAL MECHANICS

**Ambiguous Business Requirements:**
- Vague scope boundaries or undefined deliverable specifications
- Unclear success criteria or performance expectations (e.g., 'improve engagement' - by how much? measured how?)
- Undefined technical requirements, integrations, or compatibility needs
- Unclear functional requirements lacking measurable acceptance criteria
- Contradictory business objectives or conflicting priorities

**Missing Project Details:**
- Undefined baseline data or current state information needed for planning
- Missing details about existing systems, infrastructure, or resources to work with
- Unclear access to personnel, data, facilities, or other project dependencies
- Unspecified volumes, quantities, or scale (e.g., number of users, transaction volumes, data sizes)
- Missing information about stakeholders, decision-makers, or approval processes

**Unclear Deliverable Expectations:**
- Ambiguous deliverable quality standards or acceptance criteria
- Undefined level of detail, depth, or comprehensiveness expected
- Missing specifications for deliverable components or content requirements
- Unclear formats, mediums, or platforms for deliverables (beyond basic file types)
- Unspecified post-delivery support, training, or knowledge transfer expectations

**Scope & Operational Ambiguities:**
- Undefined project boundaries (what's in scope vs. out of scope)
- Unclear roles and responsibilities between client and vendor
- Missing details about existing processes, workflows, or constraints
- Ambiguous change management or governance procedures
- Unspecified assumptions about resources, timelines, or dependencies

**Technical & Business Context:**
- Missing information about target audience characteristics or needs
- Unclear business drivers, pain points, or root causes being addressed
- Undefined constraints (regulatory, technical, organizational, cultural)
- Missing context about previous attempts, lessons learned, or known challenges
- Unclear integration with existing initiatives or strategic plans

**Success Metrics & Outcomes:**
- Vague outcome expectations without quantifiable targets
- Undefined measurement methodology or data collection approaches
- Missing baseline metrics or benchmarks for comparison
- Unclear reporting frequency, KPIs, or performance monitoring approach

QUESTION FORMAT:
- Focus on clarifying BUSINESS NEEDS and PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
- Ask about scope, deliverables, success criteria, technical needs, stakeholder expectations
- Avoid questions about proposal format, submission, or evaluation process
- Frame questions to understand what needs to be delivered and how success is measured
- Use specific references to RFP content when possible

Examples of GOOD business questions:
✓ 'What is the current baseline engagement score, and what specific improvement target would be considered successful (e.g., increase from X% to Y%)?'
✓ 'How many employees are expected to participate in the focus groups and interviews, and are there specific demographic or departmental representation requirements?'
✓ 'Are there existing engagement survey tools or data sets that the vendor should analyze or integrate with, or will new instruments need to be developed?'
✓ 'What specific departmental or organizational barriers to engagement have been identified previously, if any?'
✓ 'Will the vendor have direct access to employee contact information and HR systems, or will all communication be coordinated through a college liaison?'
✓ 'What level of executive/leadership involvement is expected in the research process (interviews, review, implementation)?'
✓ 'Are there any recent organizational changes (restructuring, policy changes, leadership transitions) that should inform the research approach?'

Examples of BAD questions to AVOID:
✗ 'What format should the proposal be submitted in?' (proposal mechanics)
✗ 'How will proposals be evaluated?' (evaluation process)
✗ 'What is the budget for this project?' (already should be in budgetRange field)
✗ 'When is the proposal due?' (already in submissionDeadline field)
✗ 'Can you clarify the page limits for the proposal?' (proposal formatting)

OUTPUT: Return 5-10 questions as an array of strings, each focused on clarifying BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, PROJECT SCOPE, and DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS. Questions only - no answers, explanations, or commentary."];

Rules:
- Extract information exactly as written in the document
- If information is not found, use "Not available" for strings, false for booleans, or empty arrays for arrays
- For projectDeadline, look specifically for project completion dates, project end dates, delivery deadlines, or when the actual work must be finished - NOT proposal submission deadlines. Format all dates in USA format MM/DD/YYYY
- For questionsDeadline, look for deadlines to submit questions, clarifications, or inquiries about the RFP
- For bidMeetingDate, look for pre-proposal meetings, bid conferences, site visits, or mandatory meetings
- For bidRegistrationDate, look for vendor registration deadlines, qualification deadlines, or pre-registration requirements
- For projectType, describe the type/category of project based on the content. Be specific and descriptive (e.g., 'software_development', 'construction', 'marketing', 'consulting', 'research', etc.). If unclear, use 'general'
- For arrays, extract all relevant items as separate strings
- Be comprehensive but accurate - don't invent information
- Only use "Not available" if the information is truly not present anywhere in the document
